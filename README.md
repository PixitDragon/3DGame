Something Extra:
  I did two small things for my Something Extra. The simpler one is that I edited the rat's texture to include the word "Goal" glowing on it.
  In doing so, I learned that the Normal maps aren't saved in a file format I can edit in any of my art programs, so I couldn't make the letters
  look raised like I'd initially wanted. I probably could have figured out a way around it, but I was more focused on my other Something Extra.
  
  For the more complicated one, I tried to write code so that you respawned when you fell out of the world. I initially tried to do this with
  transform.position = new Vector3(0f,3f,0f); to put the player back at spawn. However, the code wouldn't work for some reason. It correctly 
  detected the player falling out of the world, but it wouldn't place them back at spawn. I tried running it on another computer, and it worked
  perfectly. I tried it again on my personal computer, and it still wouldn't work. I had a Unity expert I know look at it, and they were baffled.
  They were able to figure out a different way to do the same thing, by restarting the scene. Chalked it up to a Mac being a Mac. Solution works 
  for now, but this problem will probably come back to haunt me later.
